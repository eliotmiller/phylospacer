Package: phylospacer
Title: Tools for creating and plotting phyloclimate and phylomorphospaces
Description: This package takes, at a minimum, an ape-style phylogeny, a matrix
    of species' traits, and a matrix of reconstructed node traits. From these
    files it creates a phylospace object. This phylospace object can be
    modified by arguments to subset the phylogeny to a given node, including,
    if desired, all nodes between the node in question and the root of the
    tree. Points can also be jittered if desired, which can help to distinguish
    species with identical trait values. The phylospace object can then be
    plotted. A number of arguments can be modified here: whether or not to plot
    available climate or trait space behind the phylospace figure, whether to
    include species' and/or node labels in the figure, the amount by which to
    offset the species' labels, labels for the x and y axes (required), and x
    and y limits for the plot. Subsequent versions of this package will likely
    include statistical tests to be run on the phylospace object.
